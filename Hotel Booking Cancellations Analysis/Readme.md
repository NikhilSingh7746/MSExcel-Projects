# Unraveling the Mystery of Hotel Cancellations

This project focuses on understanding why hotel cancellations happen and finding ways to reduce them. Using an interactive Excel dashboard, we analyzed important factors like room preferences, seasonal trends, and guest behavior. Were cancellations caused by guests not getting their preferred rooms? Did certain times of the year lead to more cancellations? Or were some guest types more likely to cancel? With the help of data, we set out to uncover the answers.

*Room Status Mismatch: A Likely Suspect?*  

One of the first clues pointed toward room status mismatches. Guests often booked specific rooms based on their preferences, but when they were assigned an undesired room instead, cancellations surged. This mismatch played a key role in rising numbers, emphasizing the importance of aligning room availability with guest expectations.

Seasonal Trends: Peaks and Pitfalls?

Next, the data highlighted seasonal variations. Bookings were highest during peak travel months, but so were cancellations. Managing high-demand seasons and last-minute changes in travel plans contributed to the issue. Understanding these trends could help the hotel reduce cancellations during busy periods.

*Guest Type Preferences: Who Cancels More?*

Finally, we examined guest types. Couples, families, and single travelers were analyzed to see if their behavior impacted cancellations. The findings showed that couples and single travelers were more likely to cancel, as their plans were more susceptible to changes.

<b>The Outcome</b>         
-----
The investigation brought clarity. While room status mismatches, seasonal trends, and guest type preferences all played a role, each contributed differently to the problem. Equipped with these insights, the hotel could now take targeted steps to reduce cancellationsâ€”such as improving room allocation processes, preparing for seasonal fluctuations, and tailoring strategies to different guest types.

This story-driven analysis not only highlighted the causes of cancellations but also paved the way for actionable solutions, ensuring smoother operations and happier guests in the future.
